## üìö Patient Prioritization Logic

| Priority | Description                              |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 1        | Discharged Inpatients (2 weeks > 1 week) |
| 2        | Internal new referrals                   |
| 3        | External first-time referrals            |
| 4        | Review/follow-up cases                   |
| 5        | Private patients                         |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Note

- Emergency cases are **excluded** from the OPD queue (they bypass triage)
- Clinic runs on **Thursdays only** ‚Äî all scheduling targets the next Thursday
